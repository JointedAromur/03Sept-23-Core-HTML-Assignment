      Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks
      associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web
      applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include
      web design, web programming, and database management.<br />
      Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features
      and functionality of apps (web design). The term development is usually
      reserved for the actual construction of these things (that is to say, the
      programming of sites). <br />The basic tools involved in web development
      are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS
      (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. There are, however, a number of
      other programs used to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites
      that would otherwise have to be done “from scratch” by writing code. A
      number of content management systems (CMS) fall into this category,
      including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3, and Adobe Experience Manager,
      among others.
