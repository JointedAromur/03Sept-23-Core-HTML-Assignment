      Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and
      implementing the plan for designing a website in a way that is functional
      and offers a good user experience. User experience is central to the web
      designing process. Websites have an array of elements presented in ways
      that make them easy to navigate.<br />
      Web designing essentially involves working on every attribute of the
      website that people interact with, so that the website is simple and
      efficient, allows users to quickly find the information they need, and
      looks visually pleasing. All these factors, when combined, decide how well
      the website is designed.
